# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this repository, we are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment for all participants. We value the involvement of each contributor and strive to create a positive and respectful community experience. To achieve this, we expect all contributors to adhere to the following code of conduct in all interactions within the community and in the project:

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

-   Being respectful and considerate of differing viewpoints and experiences.
-   Using welcoming and inclusive language at all times.
-   Showing empathy towards other community members.
-   Being open to constructive criticism and feedback.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

-   Harassment, discrimination, or any form of offensive behavior.
-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
-   Public or private harassment or intimidation.
-   Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for maintaining a respectful environment and addressing any unacceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions within the repository and its community, as well as any public or private spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [Telegram](https://t.me/Jehonatal). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences, as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

We expect all contributors to uphold these guidelines and create a respectful and inclusive environment for the benefit of the entire community.
